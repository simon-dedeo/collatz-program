# Kontorovich challenge: exact program synthesis

This directory turns the “Collatz hardware, seed as software” proposal into
exact search objects.  It uses the accelerated odd map

```text
T(x)=(3x+1)/2^v2(3x+1)
```

on positive integers coprime to `6`.  Nothing here treats a long finite path
as a counterexample.

## Exact compiler and certificate verifier

`path_compiler.py` compiles every finite positive valuation word into the
canonical least seed in either admissible class modulo `6`.  For a word
`k_0,...,k_(N-1)`, put `S_j=sum_(i<j) k_i` and

```text
A_N = sum_(j<N) 3^(N-1-j) 2^S_j.
```

The compiler checks by exact replay that

```text
2^S_N T^N(x) = 3^N x+A_N.
```

Exactness of the final valuation fixes `x` modulo `2^(S_N+1)`; CRT with one
class modulo `3` gives the Kontorovich--Sinai progression modulo
`3*2^(S_N+1)=6*2^S_N`.  The thread's example reproduces exactly:

```bash
python3 path_compiler.py selftest
python3 path_compiler.py compile 1,1,2,2 --class 1
```

The second command returns canonical seed `199`.  JSON integers that may
exceed the interoperable 53-bit range are strings.  A stored certificate is
independently replayed with

```bash
python3 path_compiler.py verify certificate.json
```

For a cycle word, closure requires

```text
x = A_N/(2^S_N-3^N).
```

`path_compiler.py cycle WORD` emits a certificate only when the denominator
is positive, division is exact, the seed is positive and coprime to `6`, every
claimed valuation replays exactly, and the endpoint equals the seed.  Seed
`1` is explicitly classified as the trivial accelerated cycle.  Any seed
greater than `1` would be a machine-checkable disproof candidate.

## Bounded adversarial searches

`search_programs.py` has two exact modes, run together:

1. exhaustive ordered compositions through a stated total-halving bound;
2. every binary uniform substitution prolongable on `0`, through a stated
   uniform width, every coding of its two symbols by bounded positive
   valuations, and every substitution depth below an expanded-length bound.

The second family is a deliberately low-description “glider” ansatz.  Besides
cycle closure, the search asks whether the least ordinary seed stabilizes as
nested morphic prefixes grow.  Stabilization is necessary for an infinite
prescribed 2-adic program to become one fixed ordinary positive seed.  Finite
stabilization remains only a prefix event.

```bash
python3 search_programs.py --selftest
python3 search_programs.py \
  --max-total-halvings 22 \
  --max-uniform-width 4 \
  --max-k 4 \
  --max-word-length 16384 \
  --max-seed-word-length 512 \
  --output search_results.json
```

The result file records all bounds, exact counts, any cycle certificates, the
strongest seed-stabilization event, and a SHA-256 digest of the two source
files.  Cycle divisibility is tested through `--max-word-length`; the more
expensive CRT seed-stabilization test has its separately reported
`--max-seed-word-length` bound.  A negative result excludes only this finite
template class.  It does not improve the global computational verification
frontier.

## Distributed non-uniform morphic search

`search_nonuniform.py` expands the template class to every nonempty binary
morphism

```text
0 -> u,  1 -> v,
```

where `u` begins in `0` (so the fixed point is nested) and `u,v` have bounded,
not necessarily equal lengths.  Non-uniform images create growing gaps and
simple one-counter-like geometry unavailable to the uniform sweep.  The
worker carries compressed exact `(3^N,2^S,A_N)` blocks and is deterministically
sharded by morphism index.  Each shard still expands and literally replays
every closure or seed-stabilization hit.

`merge_nonuniform.py` requires every shard exactly once, checks common source
hashes and bounds, proves complete morphism-index coverage, and independently
replays any nontrivial cycle artifact.  A small two-shard regression is part
of `search_nonuniform.py --selftest`.

```bash
python3 search_nonuniform.py --selftest

# Example shard
python3 search_nonuniform.py \
  --max-image-length 6 --max-k 4 --max-depth 12 \
  --max-word-length 4096 --max-seed-word-length 512 \
  --shard-index 0 --shards 32 --output shard-000.json

# Merge only succeeds when all 32 consistent shards are present.
python3 merge_nonuniform.py --expect-shards 32 \
  --output nonuniform_results.json shard-*.json
```

`psc_nonuniform.sbatch` is the current Bridges-2 64-way launch prescription.
Its bounds are part of every shard artifact; changing the launch file creates
a different finite search and must not be silently merged with an earlier run.
