# Kontorovich challenge: exact program synthesis

This directory turns the “Collatz hardware, seed as software” proposal into
exact search objects.  It uses the accelerated odd map

```text
T(x)=(3x+1)/2^v2(3x+1)
```

on positive integers coprime to `6`.  Nothing here treats a long finite path
as a counterexample.

## Exact compiler and certificate verifier

`path_compiler.py` compiles every finite positive valuation word into the
canonical least seed in either admissible class modulo `6`.  For a word
`k_0,...,k_(N-1)`, put `S_j=sum_(i<j) k_i` and

```text
A_N = sum_(j<N) 3^(N-1-j) 2^S_j.
```

The compiler checks by exact replay that

```text
2^S_N T^N(x) = 3^N x+A_N.
```

Exactness of the final valuation fixes `x` modulo `2^(S_N+1)`; CRT with one
class modulo `3` gives the Kontorovich--Sinai progression modulo
`3*2^(S_N+1)=6*2^S_N`.  The thread's example reproduces exactly:

```bash
python3 path_compiler.py selftest
python3 path_compiler.py compile 1,1,2,2 --class 1
```

The second command returns canonical seed `199`.  JSON integers that may
exceed the interoperable 53-bit range are strings.  A stored certificate is
independently replayed with

```bash
python3 path_compiler.py verify certificate.json
```

For a cycle word, closure requires

```text
x = A_N/(2^S_N-3^N).
```

`path_compiler.py cycle WORD` emits a certificate only when the denominator
is positive, division is exact, the seed is positive and coprime to `6`, every
claimed valuation replays exactly, and the endpoint equals the seed.  Seed
`1` is explicitly classified as the trivial accelerated cycle.  Any seed
greater than `1` would be a machine-checkable disproof candidate.

## Bounded adversarial searches

`search_programs.py` has two exact modes, run together:

1. exhaustive ordered compositions through a stated total-halving bound;
2. every binary uniform substitution prolongable on `0`, through a stated
   uniform width, every coding of its two symbols by bounded positive
   valuations, and every substitution depth below an expanded-length bound.

The second family is a deliberately low-description “glider” ansatz.  Besides
cycle closure, the search asks whether the least ordinary seed stabilizes as
nested morphic prefixes grow.  Stabilization is necessary for an infinite
prescribed 2-adic program to become one fixed ordinary positive seed.  Finite
stabilization remains only a prefix event.  Lean commit `ad36f08` proves the
infinite statement exactly: in a fixed admissible mod-6 class, a stream is
legal for an ordinary positive seed if and only if its canonical prefix seeds
eventually stabilize at that seed.

```bash
python3 search_programs.py --selftest
python3 search_programs.py \
  --max-total-halvings 22 \
  --max-uniform-width 4 \
  --max-k 4 \
  --max-word-length 16384 \
  --max-seed-word-length 512 \
  --output search_results.json
```

The result file records all bounds, exact counts, any cycle certificates, the
strongest seed-stabilization event, and a SHA-256 digest of the two source
files.  Cycle divisibility is tested through `--max-word-length`; the more
expensive CRT seed-stabilization test has its separately reported
`--max-seed-word-length` bound.  A negative result excludes only this finite
template class.  It does not improve the global computational verification
frontier.

## Distributed non-uniform morphic search

`search_nonuniform.py` expands the template class to every nonempty binary
morphism

```text
0 -> u,  1 -> v,
```

where `u` begins in `0` (so the fixed point is nested) and `u,v` have bounded,
not necessarily equal lengths.  Non-uniform images create growing gaps and
simple one-counter-like geometry unavailable to the uniform sweep.  The
worker carries compressed exact `(3^N,2^S,A_N)` blocks and is deterministically
sharded by morphism index.  Each shard still expands and literally replays
every closure or seed-stabilization hit.

`merge_nonuniform.py` requires every shard exactly once, checks common source
hashes and bounds, proves complete morphism-index coverage, and independently
replays any nontrivial cycle artifact.  A small two-shard regression is part
of `search_nonuniform.py --selftest`.

```bash
python3 search_nonuniform.py --selftest

# Example shard
python3 search_nonuniform.py \
  --max-image-length 6 --max-k 4 --max-depth 12 \
  --max-word-length 4096 --max-seed-word-length 512 \
  --shard-index 0 --shards 32 --output shard-000.json

# Merge only succeeds when all 32 consistent shards are present.
python3 merge_nonuniform.py --expect-shards 32 \
  --output nonuniform_results.json shard-*.json
```

`psc_nonuniform.sbatch` is the current Bridges-2 64-way launch prescription.
Its bounds are part of every shard artifact; changing the launch file creates
a different finite search and must not be silently merged with an earlier run.

## One-counter shadows of negative cycles

`search_shadow.py` turns a supercritical negative cycle into a finite carry
controller.  This does **not** use a negative integer as a counterexample.  For
the controller state `c<0`, valuation word `w`, and

```text
P=3^|w| > Q=2^sum(w),
```

a positive state `x=c+Q^M h` with odd `h` shadows `w` for `M` repetitions.
If the last valuation gains exactly `e` further powers of two, exact replay
gives the collision endpoint

```text
x'=(c+P^M h)/2^e.
```

The one-counter ansatz asks that `x'=c+Q^(M+1)h'`, replenishing the precision
spent by the collision.  With bounded `e`, sufficiently large successful
macrosteps grow because `(P/Q)^M/2^e>1`.  An infinite exact renewal would be a
candidate for the Lean `MacroGlider` endpoint; any finite chain is only a
prefix event.

```bash
python3 search_shadow.py --selftest
python3 search_shadow.py \
  --max-start-level 6 --max-extra 8 --max-program-depth 4 \
  --output shadow_results.json
```

The committed artifact exhausts the negative cycles at `-5` with word
`(1,2)` and `-17` with word `(1,1,1,2,1,1,4)`, every start level `1..6`, all
extra-valuation words over `{1,...,8}` of length at most four, and both
admissible classes modulo `6`.  All `112,320` compiled paths pass literal
valuation and shifted-coordinate replay.  There are zero ordinary-seed
stabilization events and zero terminal next-level renewals in this stated
class.  Source digest:
`dc33070c7d14db452aafe19c59ce097e301e895c593e2c0ec2d89424b2d72696`.

## Phase-changing shadow collisions

`search_phase_shadow.py` allows a carry collision to land near a different
phase of the same negative cycle.  At level `M`, a symbol `(i,e)` means: start
near negative phase `c_i`, run `M` copies of the valuation word rotated to
that phase, and add `e` powers of two at the terminal collision.  The next
symbol must start near its selected phase modulo `Q^(M+1)`.  The worker checks
the shifted-coordinate formula and literally replays every positive path.

Two committed runs use different bounds because the cycles have two and seven
phases:

```bash
python3 search_phase_shadow.py --selftest
python3 search_phase_shadow.py --cycle minus5 \
  --min-start-level 1 --max-start-level 12 \
  --max-extra 8 --max-program-depth 4 \
  --output phase_minus5_results.json
python3 search_phase_shadow.py --cycle minus17 \
  --min-start-level 1 --max-start-level 6 \
  --max-extra 4 --max-program-depth 3 \
  --output phase_minus17_results.json
```

The `-5/-7` artifact exhausts `838,848` phase/extra programs and `1,677,696`
compiled paths in the two mod-6 classes.  It finds 15 terminal next-level
renewals and 10 one-extension canonical-seed stabilizations.  All renewals
start at level one or two, every next macro shrinks, and every event loses
alignment immediately after that added macro.  A compact regression is

```text
phase/extra:  (-7,2), (-5,3), (-7,1), (-7,1)
levels:       1,      2,      3,      4
macro states: 53403857 -> 15019835 -> 2376185 -> 1691641 -> 1354843.
```

The same ordinary seed is canonical before and after the fourth macro, but
`1354843` is in neither negative phase class at precision level five.  This is
an exact finite carry-renewal example, not a divergent orbit.

The seven-phase `-17` artifact exhausts `136,584` programs and `273,168`
compiled paths; it finds no stabilization or renewal.  Together the artifacts
check `1,950,864` paths.  Their common source digest is
`b830ebcea08fb1822b204bfcd60a1570870ffa5a170b14f0d12fbb68bcc857cc`.

The soundness endpoint is kernel-checked.  Lean commits `3d9cedc`/`93cafe1`
prove the shifted-coordinate identity, eventual strict growth when collision
extras are uniformly bounded, and the literal negation of Collatz from an
infinite exact phase-renewal witness.  Commits `edcee1a`/`0d8c3d2` check the
signed `-5` and `-17` cycles and prove that every rotated phase supplies the
required affine controller.  The finite artifacts above do not instantiate
the infinite witness type.

## Mersenne shadows of the signed fixed point `-1`

`search_mersenne_shadow.py` treats `c=-1`, `w=(1)` as a one-counter
controller.  A positive state `x=2^M h-1` with odd `h` has `M-1` exact
valuation-one steps before its collision; if the last valuation is `1+e`, the
endpoint is exactly

```text
x'=(3^M h-1)/2^e.
```

The next level requires `x'=2^(M+1)h'-1`.  This is the simplest realization
of a high Mersenne-like packet feeding the low `+1` boundary, and its nominal
multiplier `3/2` is strongly outward when collision extras remain bounded.

```bash
python3 search_mersenne_shadow.py --selftest
python3 search_mersenne_shadow.py \
  --min-start-level 1 --max-start-level 100 \
  --max-extra 12 --max-program-depth 3 \
  --continuation-steps 100000 \
  --output mersenne_shadow_results.json
```

The artifact exhausts `188,400` extra programs and `376,800` compiled paths
in both admissible mod-6 classes.  It records 522 terminal next-level
renewals, 80 canonical-seed stabilizations, and three stabilizations for which
every macrostep is strictly outward.  The strongest is

```text
start level:  7
extras:       4, 3, 1
macro states: 24017279 -> 25647359 -> 82164223 -> 1579334395.
```

The seed is already canonical before the third macro, but the last state is
not `-1` modulo `2^10`.  Exact continuation reaches `1` after 108 accelerated
steps, with peak `8,538,035,597`.  The highest terminal renewal in the search
starts at level 10 and its added level-13 macro grows, but alignment then
fails.  Thus this artifact verifies finite outward packet behavior while
closing only its stated depth-three grammar.  Source digest:
`9e0be5ec96ed81eebe55c7b7f2281309eef13f7ca0da10638604afd2c1d4ac8f`.

Lean commit `768f4d0` independently checks the signed `(-1,[1])` controller,
proves the exact Mersenne macro identity used here, replays the
`24,017,279` outward event and its level-10 failure, and exposes the literal
Collatz-refutation theorem from an infinite `MersenneShadowOrbit`.  The finite
artifact does not inhabit that all-level structure.

`search_mersenne_constants.py` separately exhausts the simplest feedback
grammar, one constant collision extra:

```bash
python3 search_mersenne_constants.py --selftest
python3 search_mersenne_constants.py \
  --max-start-level 20 --max-extra 32 --max-depth 40 \
  --continuation-steps 100000 \
  --output mersenne_constant_results.json
```

Across `51,200` compiled paths, the unique two-extension stabilization is

```text
constant extra: 1
start level:    1
macro states:   121 -> 91 -> 103 -> 175 -> 445.
```

Seed `121` is the canonical representative for depths two, three, and four.
The fifth macro fails, and exact continuation reaches `1` after 34 accelerated
steps with peak `3077`.  No other constant extra through 32 produces two
extensions within the stated bounds.  Source digest:
`dd0ca553197fa5881a2db36ed2dde00984d7750efc1412bff4648b0b9238ed04`.

`search_mersenne_periodic.py` expands the feedback class to every primitive
periodic extra template within explicit bounds.  The macro valuation word is
still aperiodic because its length increases; only the extra controller is
periodic.  The worker uses the Lean-checked compressed affine macro and
expands plus literally replays every stabilization hit.

```bash
python3 search_mersenne_periodic.py --selftest
python3 search_mersenne_periodic.py \
  --max-start-level 30 --max-extra 8 --max-period 3 --max-depth 80 \
  --continuation-steps 100000 \
  --output mersenne_periodic_results.json
```

The artifact exhausts 568 primitive templates and `2,726,400` compiled
prefixes.  It finds 119 seed-stabilization events, three all-outward events,
and one two-extension event.  The latter is exactly constant extra `1` at
seed `121`; the strongest outward event is exactly period `(4,3,1)` at seed
`24,017,279`.  Both fail as documented above and reach `1`.  Thus no short
periodic template improves the known finite motifs.  Source digest:
`27447b305fc295f6225aa045eaa7110d5ccc44ae66055356de9afa7d5842ba49`.

Lean commits `32a0896`--`a2652f2` now expose the narrow all-level target

```text
2^e_t (2^(M+t+1) h_(t+1)-1) = 3^(M+t) h_t-1.
```

From positive odd packets and uniformly bounded extras satisfying this
recurrence, Lean derives the macro legality, eventual packet growth, and the
literal Collatz refutation.  It also proves the unique necessary residue class
for `h_(t+1)` modulo `3^(M+t)`.  That scheduler is the next search filter.
