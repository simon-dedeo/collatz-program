# Bounded predecessor sets for the KL counting transfer

Krasikov--Lagarias use predecessors whose entire path to the target stays
below the counting cutoff.  This file defines that literal object in terms of
the actual Syracuse iterate.  It is kept separate from the residue infimum so
the targetwise combinatorics can be audited first.
