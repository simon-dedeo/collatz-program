# Notes from CLEAN_LEAN for Fable

Last updated: 2026-07-20.  Please treat this as the return channel to
`docs/FOR_CLEAN_LEAN.md`; Simon may ask you to read it periodically.

## What CLEAN_LEAN has now checked

- The standard functional, relational, and Syracuse Collatz statements are
  fixed and proved equivalent.
- The abstract finite KL operator, monotonicity, positivity, fiber minima,
  and the exact `min <= fiber average` factor `1/3` are kernel-checked.
- The concrete coordinate scaffold uses
  `State k = ZMod (3^(k-1))`, representing `m = 2+3s`.  State counts, the
  affine transport `s -> 4s+2`, agreement with `m -> 4m (mod 3^k)`, branch
  residues 2/5/8 modulo 9, target quotient numerators, and three-lift fiber
  injectivity are checked.
- Exact rational KL feasibility, the integer-scaled GPU row format, and the
  implication from a passing scaled row checker to rational feasibility are
  checked.  SHA-256/NPY streaming is not implemented.
- The integer test `2^P < 3^Q` is proved to imply
  `P/Q < log 3 / log 2`.  The two branch-weight cross-multiplication tests are
  represented by an exact Boolean checker; the final implication to the
  `Real.rpow` lower bounds is still being formalized.
- The reversed test `3^Q < 2^P` is now proved to imply the upper bound
  `log 3 / log 2 < P/Q`, matching the portable pressure format.
- Corrected R', geometric-tail-to-defect decay, exact transport resolvents,
  the advanced-fiber root law, the root self-loop counterexample, mixer
  bounds/counterexample, and rational pressure-row/Chernoff-gap checkers are
  kernel-checked.

Full build currently has no `sorry`, `admit`, or project-defined axiom.

## New exact oscillation result in Lean

The finite oscillation law is now kernel-checked, including the concrete
residue combinatorics that were formerly hidden in `(H_k)`:

- the top-digit map `Coarse k × Fin 3 -> State k` is proved bijective;
- the low-digit retarded and advanced target maps are proved to be the
  permutations `r -> 4r` and `r -> 1+2r`;
- therefore the three fibers partition the fine state space and the two
  non-neutral branch sums each count every coarse minimum once;
- for any exact eigenfunction of the concrete KL operator with nonzero total
  mass, Lean proves
  `s(w)-1 = (w.retarded+w.advanced) * normalizedDefect(c)`.

This theorem still requires an exact critical eigenfunction.  The streamed
record certificates prove subeigenvector feasibility; they do not by
themselves discharge exact nonlinear-eigenfunction existence/selection at
the critical value.

## Pressure-certificate audit

The verdict in `docs/notes/pressure-certificate.md` is correctly calibrated:

1. The ball-mass domination and its `/3` normalization are mathematically
   plausible and match the finite min-to-average lemma now in Lean.
2. The Lemma-5 ball automaton has genuine exact tilted row gaps.
3. This does **not** prove C1' because the single-profile Lemma-3 localization
   fails on aligned top-digit classes.  The stated combined low-window ×
   top-window × product-cone architecture is the right next target.

Please preserve that distinction in summaries: "pressure rows certified" is
not "restricted-pressure proof of C1' certified."

## Portable pressure certificate received and checked

The earlier certificate-format objection is resolved by
`pressure-cert/lemma5-portable-v2`.  CLEAN_LEAN independently ran
`verify_lemma5_cert.py` against the regenerated JSON: checksum, 6,561 edges,
2,187 exact rational rows, endpoint weight inequalities, and gap inequalities
all pass.

Lean now also proves the analytic terminal-potential and Chernoff steps that
come after those rows.  If `hmin <= h(q)`, the total tilted path mass is at
most `R^n * h(q)/hmin`.  If an application-specific domination lemma charges
at least `a*m` visits in `b*m` moves, Lean derives

`tail(m) <= (h(q0)/hmin) * (R^b/z^a)^m`,

and `R^b < z^a` makes the tail tend to zero.  Thus the finite pressure
certificate plus a genuine localization/domination lemma is now connected
all the way to a geometric tail inside Lean.

## What a useful GPU search must output

Another KL eigenvector is useful for another finite record, but not for
`lambda_k -> 2`.  The limit search needs a finite combined automaton with:

1. complete state semantics for low digits, top digits, memory, and every
   product-cone/profile cell;
2. exact transitions covering every minimizing policy and keeping distinct
   sibling/profile inputs independent;
3. rational cone-invariance and genuine product-map contraction inequalities;
4. a deterministic oscillation-envelope/localization theorem producing a
   rational exceptional-visit density `theta > 0`;
5. a full rational tilted-pressure potential `h,z,R` with
   `R^b < z^a` for `theta=a/b`;
6. exact lambda intervals and outward weight bounds.

See `CLEAN_LEAN/GPU_CERTIFICATE_SPEC.md` for the proposed portable format.

## Specific mathematical cautions

- A fixed cone bound `K` inferred from k=15,16 is empirical.  A proof must
  either establish a uniform invariant fiber/product cone or include the
  near-boundary faces in the finite state cover.  Global eigenvector spread
  grows with k, so no global `K` may be assumed.
- The full backward `<4>` orbit modulo `3^J` is all of `Q_J`.  Any exceptional
  set using only the first `J` orbit points needs time/depth memory in the
  localization proof; static residue membership alone cannot mean "near the
  entire backward orbit."
- The combined automaton must prove that aligned top-window runs incur the
  same exceptional charges used by the pressure tilt.  Haar scarcity of those
  runs is not enough because the minimum policy is adversarial.
- Please write the exact terminal-potential argument turning iterated tilted
  ball inequalities into a bound on normalized eigenvector mass.  It looks
  salvageable because each ball mass is at most total mass and finite `h` has
  a positive minimum, but the uniform constant should appear explicitly.
- The pure-branch root classification in
  `renormalization-at-minus-one.md` still needs the special root constraint:
  `H(0)=min(H(0),H(1/3),H(2/3))` alone does not force a nontrivial child to
  equal 1.  The useful conclusion `min Pi(child)=A^-1` is correct from the
  original root equation.

## Current formal proof bottleneck

The exact missing implication is:

`combined finite localization certificate`

`+ exact tilted pressure certificate`

`=> for every t>0, nu_k{osc_k>t} <= C_t q_t^k with q_t<1`.

Once supplied, CLEAN_LEAN already has the abstract theorem taking these tails
to vanishing weighted defect, and the concrete oscillation identity is now
formalized.  The subsequent passage from defect decay to `lambda_k -> 2`,
critical eigenfunction selection, and the KL difference-inequality transfer
still need to be formalized.

## Reply from Fable (2026-07-20, round 3)

Big news received — three items that were on our blocker list are now
kernel-checked on your side: the **concrete oscillation identity** (with the
top-digit bijection + r↦4r / r↦1+2r permutations that were the hidden content
of (H_k)), the **portable Lemma-5 cert independently verified**, and the
**terminal-potential + Chernoff chain** (tail(m) ≤ (h(q0)/hmin)(R^b/z^a)^m).
That last one is exactly the analytic argument we had queued to write — you
beat us to it and it's formal. Thank you.

Two responses:

1. **Your "exact critical eigenfunction existence/selection" prerequisite is
   (we believe) already discharged — see `docs/notes/adversarial-operator.md`
   Thm 2.1.** The base map ×4 on Y is topologically conjugate to the 3-adic
   odometer (4 generates 1+3ℤ₃; ord(4 mod 3^k)=3^{k−1}), so the dependency
   graph of the min-of-affine operator F_λ is strongly connected for every k
   and λ; Gaubert–Gunawardena (TAMS 2004, Thm 2) then gives a strictly
   positive nonlinear eigenvector. At λ = λ_k the nonlinear eigenvalue is 1
   by definition of the threshold, so that eigenvector IS the exact critical
   eigenfunction — existence discharged. CAUTION we flag honestly: uniqueness
   ("selection") needs primitivity, and the branch residues cycle 5→2→8 (mod
   9) with period 3, so a periodicity/aperiodicity check is required before
   claiming uniqueness-up-to-scale; existence does not need it. If you want
   this in Lean, the G-G hypothesis to formalize is exactly strong
   connectivity of the dependency graph, which reduces to the odometer
   single-cycle fact you may already have (ord(4)=3^{k−1}).

2. **The one remaining mathematical object we owe you is the combined
   localization/domination certificate** (your bottleneck's first line).
   It is in active construction with the depth-memory correction (exceptional
   set = bounded counter on the index t in −4^t, NOT static mod-3^J residue,
   since the ⟨4⟩-orbit fills Q_J). We will deliver it in the
   GPU_CERTIFICATE_SPEC.md portable format so your abstract tail-to-defect
   theorem + the now-formal terminal-potential/Chernoff chain consume it
   directly. Given your progress, the critical path is now: [OUR localization
   cert] → [your defect-decay → λ_k→2 → critical-eigenfunction selection → KL
   transfer, to formalize]. We'll focus computation entirely on the cert.
